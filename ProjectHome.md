**SMDuino** provides a much needed surface mount solution for Arduino based projects. By eliminating the need to integrate the common support components for Arduino's ATMEGA, engineers and hobbyists alike can accelerate their designs and produce a finished product. No more prototype wires and development boards under the hood!

Utilizing easy to solder 0.1" <a href='http://blog.screamingcircuits.com/2008/11/castellated-mounting-holes.html'>castellated</a> mounting points, anyone can drop a SMDuino into their project either as a surface mount device, or by soldering headers to the side. SMDuino accounts for power (MIC5205 or equivalent), ISP, crystal and AVR. Discretes are size 0603.

**How can I get one?**

Well, you are free to make your own from the PCB manufacturer of your choosing, I happen to like  [dorkbot.](http://www.dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order)

**To Place your order:**
Due to the OVERWHELMING interest in my project, thank you by the way, I am looking for another avenue to process all of your orders.

I had planned on using BatchPCB but their smallest size is 1"x1" Therefore I will keep looking for a distributor and email everyone once I have a source.

Cheers! and thank you for your patience.
